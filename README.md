## Installation and Usage

### Run app by docker

In the project directory, you can run:

### `docker-compose up`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### OR run app on your local machine
Here's how to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

node version - v16.17.1

To setup this project please use:

### `npm install`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Running ESLint

To run ESLint and check your code for errors or style issues, use the following command:

### `npm run lint`

ESLint will analyze your JavaScript and TypeScript files and report any problems or inconsistencies. You can find the ESLint configuration in the .eslintrc.js file.

### Running Prettier

To format your code using Prettier, use the following command:

### `npm run format`

Prettier will automatically format your code according to the rules specified in the .prettierrc configuration file.

### Modifying ESLint and Prettier Configuration
If you want to change the ESLint or Prettier configuration, you can do so by editing the respective configuration files:

- ESLint Configuration: .eslintrc.js
- Prettier Configuration: .prettierrc

Make your desired changes to these files, save them, and then run the relevant ESLint or Prettier command to apply the updated configuration.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
